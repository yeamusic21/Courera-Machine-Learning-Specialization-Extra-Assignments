# Coursera Machine Learning Specialization - Extra Assignments for Greater Learning

## Intro:
I'm taking the Coursera Machine Learning Specialization by University of Washington. To further my learning I have created extra assignments for myself, forcing me to code up concepts from scratch.  

## Tools:
Most of these workbooks will be coded in Python, and most likely with emphasis on numpy.

## Summary:
This repository is to share my learnings and code for anyone elses use or further development in the field.
